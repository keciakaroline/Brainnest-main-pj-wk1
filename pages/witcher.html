		<h1>This page is about The Witcher</h1>
		<h3>
			<p>
				The Witcher is a 2007 action role-playing game, based on the fantasy
				novel series The Witcher.
			</p>
			<p>
				The story takes place in a medieval fantasy world and follows Geralt of
				Rivia, one of a few traveling monster hunters who have supernatural
				powers, known as Witcher. The game's system of moral choices was noted
				for its time-delayed consequences and lack of black-and-white morality.
